Install Android Studio on Ubuntu 20.04

1 - Make sure that Oracle JDK is install: check it by executing the command # java -version . Thed second line of the result should be something like "Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment..."

2 - Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation folder. By default it is in "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-<version>/". Edit /etc/profile file and add the following line at its end

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-<version>/

3 - Download Android Studio. Following this link https://developer.android.com/studio/ , download the suitable version for Linux

4 - Extract Android Studio archive file downloaded and note the location on the filesystem. For our case, we extracted in ~/AndroidStudio/ with the following commands :

	$ mkdir AndroidStudio
	$ mv <path_to_android_studio_archive> AndroidStudio/
	$ cd AndroidStudio
	$ tar -xzvf <android_studio_archive_filename>
This will create a sub-folder "android-studio" in "AndroidStudio" folder

5 - Launch AndroidStudio with following commands : 

	$ cd android-studio/bin	
	$ ./studio.sh
For the first launching, make sure to have internet access for downloading componets to be used during setup.

6 - Set ANDROID_HOME variable to the location where Android SDK has been installed during startup. By default, it is ~/Android/Sdk. In that case, add the following lines at the end of ~/.profile file
Also modify default PATH environment variable in ~/.profile file by the same mean.

export ANDROID_HOME=/home/nkenne/Android/Sdk/
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
Its sometimes needed to log out and log in the current user for the changes of this step and that of step 2 be effective
